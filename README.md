# MATH4100 Indutrial Problems in Applied Math

## Problem Statement:

IntelyCare uses data and technology to help long-term care facilities find the extra help they need on a per-shift basis from our pool of credentialed nursing professionals. We give nursing professionals full flexibility to work as much or as little as they choose, and we observe substantial variance in usage across our pool of nurses. Our goal is to identify cohorts of nurses with similar in-app behaviors. Who are nurses that accept whatever shift we show them? Who are the nurses who only work when they find the exact shift they like? Which nurses can work more shifts in a week and which nurses cannot? Who are the weekend warriors? Who are the holiday heroes? . 

These behavioral cohorts will allow us to personalize the nurse experience in important ways. We can send more timely and relevant communications, improve our in-app shift recommendations, and offer more effective promotions if we understand what behavior patterns characterize a given nursing professional. 

For this project, we will use some machine learning techniques such as PCA, k-mean cluestring and other statistical techniques. 

## Week 1 to 5:

Build knowledeges for the project such as clustering and classification in Machine Learning filed. We also did some data pre-processing and data visualization for the dataset to see the features of the data by pid. 

## Weel 6 to 7:

Will apply PCA and k-mean clustering method to data set.
